# Insights into the UIUC student population

## Organization Name
University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign
 
## Overview
The University of Illinois has a very diverse student body. It welcomes students from all over the world and from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds. The goal of this project is to provide some meaningful insights into different aspects of the University's student population (e.g., enrollment, graduation rates, financial aid, etc.).

## Problem Statement
Use the information in the provided sources (and/or any other external sources if you would like) to provide meaningful insights into the UIUC student population. Some ideas include predicting future class enrollment based on historical trends (to properly allocate resources), the diversity of the student body in the years to come, who is most likely to need financial aid, who is most likely to drop out and potential reasons why, or even a data visualization showing changes in student demographics over the years. The project is very open as long as you provide some insights related to the University.

## Evaluation criteria
Meaningful insights into UIUC demographics
