# Forecasting the UIUC student population

## Organization Name
University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign
 
## Overview
The University of Illinois has a very diverse student body. It welcomes students from all over the world and from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds. The goal of this project is to provide some meaningful insights into different aspects of the University's student population (e.g., enrollment, graduation rates, financial aid, etc.).

## Problem Statement
Forecasting UIUC enrollment is a valuable endeavor to help understand the future viability of various parts of the university and provide insights into allocation of resources.  The forecast can be granular broken out by undergraduate and graduate programs, or can be an overall forecast.

## Evaluation criteria
Minimum mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) in forecasting UIUC enrollment
